## My Sublime Text 3 Configuration

I needed a way to save my configuration and since there shouldn't be anything secret here, why not make it a repo?

## Installation and Locations
Before "installing" these settings, make sure you have closed Sublime Text 3. Then, change to the appropriate directory and clone the git repo.

* Mac OSX
  ```
  $ cd ~/Libary/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/
  ```
  
* Ubuntu (Linux)
  ```
  $ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/
  ```
  
* Windows (Active Directory user)
  ```
  > cd "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\"

* Clone the repo
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:brandonmoser/st3_config.git
  ```
  
* Start Sublime to confirm changes
